The sources provided focus on analytical and experimental Terahertz (THz) channel modeling through the integration of ray tracing techniques. They discuss the development of hybrid channel models that combine ray-tracing and statistical methods for THz indoor communications, aiming to accurately characterize channel characteristics in the THz band. These studies present implementations of ray tracing for sub-THz channel modeling, propose ray-tracing-statistical hybrid channel models for low-Terahertz indoor communications, and explore large-scale and small-scale fading using a ray-tracing-statistical hybrid channel model in THz scenarios. The research emphasizes the importance of understanding radio propagation science in the context of THz frequencies for improved wireless communication systems.
